# Restaurant
This application aims to solve the problem of food ordering in restaurants, where users have to scan through menus usually in paper form, place orders, and make payments at the point of sale afterward. This application will ensure orders will be placed from the phone after scanning a barcode that represents the restaurant URL. Payment will be made right after the order has been placed, there will also be an option to pay at the point of sale. Future releases will include a home delivery options.
